## 🧪 How It Works

1. 📄 You upload a PDF.
2. ✂️ The PDF is split into semantically meaningful chunks.
3. 🧬 Chunks are embedded using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.
4. 🧠 Embeddings are stored in **ChromaDB**.
5. ❓ You ask a question.
6. 🔍 Similar chunks are retrieved based on embedding similarity.
7. 🗣️ A prompt is constructed and sent to **Gemini 2.5 Pro**.
8. 🤖 You get a relevant and context-aware answer.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/talktopdf.git
cd talktopdf
````

### 2. Create virtual environment and install dependencies

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Mac/Linux
.\venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file (use `.env.example` as a template):

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
# Optional: comma-separated list of allowed frontend origins (defaults to http://localhost:8501)
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:8501
```

### 4. Start the backend

```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

### 5. Launch the frontend

```bash
streamlit run frontend/app.py
```

> ⚠️ Make sure both the FastAPI backend and the Streamlit frontend are running at the same time.
